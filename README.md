I am Lazar Janković, and I recently completed my studies at the Faculty of Economics. During my studies, I developed a passion for data processing and analysis, which inspired me to pursue a career in data science. Through my work, I have refined my skills in data analysis and gained the ability to recognize key patterns and trends that can contribute to better decision-making.

My education has provided me with a solid foundation in working with economic data, statistical methods, and analytical tools. I am highly motivated to use my technical skills to solve complex problems and uncover new insights through data.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new techniques and tools for data analysis, always seeking opportunities to improve my knowledge and skills. Whether working independently or in a team, I thrive on the challenges that come with working with data and the opportunity to contribute to innovative solutions.
